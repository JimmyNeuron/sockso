HACKING
=======

This file contains some basic information on how to set up a Sockso development
environment.  So basically, what you'll need...

Essentials
----------

1) JDK 1.5+ (http://java.sun.com)
Sockso (and some of it's libraries) require atleast JDK 1.5.  The official
releases are compiled with this.

2) Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)
All of the compiling, running, packaging and testing of Sockso is done with Ant,
so it's an essential really (unless ur mental and want to do things on your own)

3) PHP 4+ (http://www.php.net)
Some of the build process uses PHP scripts to do some stuff, so you'll need this
installed to or you won't get far (again, unless ur mental)

4) Bazaar (http://bazaar-vcs.org)
You should already have this is you're reading this file, but just incase you
got this code some other way, go get Bazaar right now.

Optional
--------

1) IDE
Some people love them, others (mentalists) hate them, but I'd reccomend using
Netbeans (http://netbeans.org).  There are lots of others to but I find this
one pretty good.

Configuration
-------------

First make a copy of the file "sockso.properties-sample" and rename it to just
"sockso.properties".  Then, as long as you're using Ant, pretty much everything
should be ready to go.  If you're using an IDE then you'll probably need to
point it to all the Jar files in the "lib", "lib-dev" and "lib-opt" directories or it'll
complain about all the imports.  Otherwise try some of these useful Ant tasks...

1) run - Builds a working Sockso distribution in the "dist" folder, and runs it.
2) package - Makes nice packages for Sockso.
3) test-all - Run all the unit tests
4) test-single -Dclass=CLASSNAME - Run a specific class's tests

Further Help
------------

If any of this doesn't make sense, or you're stuck, or you just feel like it,
come to the forums and talk about Sockso at:
